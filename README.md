## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, and predicting churn can help retain customers and improve business strategies. This project leverages an ANN to classify whether a customer is likely to churn based on their behavior and other features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains customer information, including demographic details, usage patterns, and churn status. You can use a publicly available churn dataset or your own dataset.

### Features:
- Customer demographics (e.g., age, gender)
- Account details (e.g., tenure, charges)
- Churn label (binary: 0 or 1)

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/1rishu0/ANN-Classification-Churn.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd ANN-Classification-Churn

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Preprocess the data by running the preprocessing script or notebook:

```bash
python scripts/preprocess_data.py
```

2. Train the ANN model:

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```

3. Evaluate the model:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_model.py
```

4. Visualize results using the provided notebooks or scripts.

## Model Architecture

The ANN model consists of:

- Input layer matching the number of features
- Hidden layers with ReLU activation
- Output layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification

## Results

- **Accuracy:** [Include accuracy metric here]
- **Precision:** [Include precision metric here]
- **Recall:** [Include recall metric here]
- **F1 Score:** [Include F1 score here]

Visualizations and detailed results can be found in the `results/` directory.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the ANN
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For visualizations
